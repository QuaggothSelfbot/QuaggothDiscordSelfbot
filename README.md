# What is Quaggoth?
Quaggoth is a Discord Selfbot I made by yoinking a lot of open source code. I am not responsible for anything you do with this tool.

# Requirements:
Python 3.8.0: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-380/

Microsoft C++ Visual Studio Build Tools: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/ (Make sure to select C++ Build Tools when installing.)

# Installation:
1. Download the files as a ZIP and extract.
2. Run the *install.bat* file.
3. Open the *config.json* file and provide your Discord Token and Password in the appropriate fields (your password does not have to be the same as your Discord one.)
4. Run the *launch.bat* file.
5. Create a shortcut of *launch.bat* and rename it to anything you want!
